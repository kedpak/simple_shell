.SH NAME
.B Simple Shell
- This program recreates a custom simple shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
This simple shell can execute some basic bash commands from the command line interpreter. It emulates a command line interpreter, that represents a user interface program. Utilizes system commands and certain commands found in $PATH. The path is checked and if specified commands are found, those commands will be executed. Custom builtins are also taken into account. Works for both interactive and non-interactive mode. 

.B PATH
Commands that are found inside the $PATH can be executed. Can be called both by directly inputing the file location or command itself. 

Example:
/bin/ls - will print files in current directory  ---- ls - will print files in current directory \


.B BUILT-INS
The 'env' and 'exit' builtins can be executed
